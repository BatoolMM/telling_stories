<h2 data-number="8.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter is about hunting data with experiments. This is a situation in which we can explicitly control and vary what we are interested in. The advantage of this is that identifying and estimating an effect should be clear. There is a treatment group that is subject to what we are interested in, and a control group that is not. These are randomly split before treatment. And so, if they end up different, then it must be because of the treatment. Unfortunately, life is rarely so smooth. Arguing about how similar the treatment and control groups were tends to carry on indefinitely. And before we can estimate an effect, we need to be able to measure whatever it is that we are interested in, which is often surprisingly difficult.</p>
<p>By way of motivation, consider the situation of someone who moved to San Francisco in 2014–as soon as they moved the Giants won the World Series and the Golden State Warriors began a historic streak of World Championships. They then moved to Chicago, and immediately the Cubs won the World Series for the first time in 100 years. They then moved to Massachusetts, and the Patriots won the Super Bowl again, and again, and again. And finally, they moved to Toronto, where the Raptors immediately won the World Championship. Should a city pay them to move, or could municipal funds be better spent elsewhere?</p>
<p>One way to get at the answer would be to run an experiment. Make a list of the North American cities with major sports teams. Then roll a dice, send them to live there for a year, and measure the outcomes of the sports teams. With enough lifetimes, we could work it out. This would take a long time because we cannot both live in a city and not live in a city. This is the fundamental problem of causal inference: a person cannot be both treated and untreated. Experiments and randomized controlled trials are circumstances in which we try to randomly allocate some treatment, to have a belief that everything else was the same (or at least ignorable). We use the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework to formalize the situation <span class="citation" data-cites="holland1986statistics">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-holland1986statistics" role="doc-biblioref">Holland 1986</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A treatment, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, will often be a binary variable, that is either 0 or 1. It is 0 if the person, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, is not treated, which is to say they are in the control group, and 1 if they are treated. We will typically have some outcome, <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, of interest for that person, and that could be binary, categorical, multinomial, ordinal, continuous, or possibly even some other type. For instance, it could be vote choice, in which case we could measure whether the person is: “Conservative” or “Not Conservative”; which party they support, say: “Conservative”, “Liberal”, “Democratic”, “Green”; or maybe a probability of support.</p>
<p>The effect of a treatment is then causal if <span class="math inline">\((Y_i|t=0) \neq (Y_i|t=1)\)</span>. That is to say, the outcome for person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, given they were not treated, is different to their outcome given they were treated. If we could both treat and control the one individual at the one time, then we would know that it was only the treatment that had caused any change in outcome, as there could be no other factor to explain it. But the fundamental problem of causal inference remains: we cannot both treat and control the one individual at the one time. So, when we want to know the effect of the treatment, we need to compare it with a counterfactual. The counterfactual, introduced in <a href="04-writing_research.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;4</span></a>, is what would have happened if the treated individual were not treated. As it turns out, this means one way to think of causal inference is as a missing data problem, where we are missing the counterfactual.</p>
<p>As we cannot compare treatment and control in one individual, we instead compare the average of two groups—those treated and those not. We are looking to estimate the counterfactual at a group level because of the impossibility of doing it at an individual level. Making this trade-off allows us to move forward but comes at the cost of certainty. We must instead rely on randomization, probabilities, and expectations.</p>
<p>We usually consider a default of there being no effect and we look for evidence that would cause us to change our mind. As we are interested in what is happening in groups, we turn to expectations and notions of probability to express ourselves. Hence, we will make claims that apply on average. Maybe wearing fun socks really does make you have a lucky day, but on average, across the group, it is probably not the case. It is worth pointing out that we do not just have to be interested in the average effect. We may consider the median, or variance, or whatever. Nonetheless, if we were interested in the average effect, then one way to proceed would be to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>divide the dataset in two—treated and not treated—and have a binary effect column;</li>
<li>sum the column, then divide it by the length of the column; and</li>
<li>compare the value of this division in the two groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an estimator, introduced in <a href="04-writing_research.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;4</span></a>, which is a way of putting together a guess of something of interest. The estimand is the thing of interest, in this case the average effect, and the estimate is whatever our guess turns out to be. We can simulate data to illustrate the situation.</p>

<p>More broadly, to tell causal stories we need to bring together both theory and a detailed knowledge of what we are interested in <span class="citation" data-cites="Cunningham2021">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Cunningham2021" role="doc-biblioref">Cunningham 2021, 4</a>)</span>. In <a href="07-gather.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;7</span></a> we discussed gathering data that we observed about the world. In this chapter we are going to be more active about turning the world into the data that we need. As the researcher, we will decide what to measure and how, and we will need to define what we are interested in. We will be active participants in the data-generating process. That is, if we want to use this data, then as researchers we must go out and hunt it.</p>
<p>In this chapter we cover experiments, especially constructing treatment and control groups, and appropriately considering their results. We go through implementing a survey. We discuss some aspects of ethical behavior in experiments through reference to the abhorrent Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) experiment and go through various case studies. Finally, we then turn to A/B testing, which is extensively used in industry, and consider a case study based on Upworthy data.</p>
<p>Ronald Fisher, the twentieth century statistician, and Francis Galton, the nineteenth century statistician, are the intellectual grandfathers of much of the work that we cover in this chapter. In some cases it is directly their work, in other cases it is work that built on their contributions. Both men believed in eugenics, amongst other things that are generally reprehensible. In the same way that art history acknowledges, say, Caravaggio as a murderer, while also considering his work and influence, so too must statistics and the data sciences more generally concern themselves with this past, at the same time as we try to build a better future.</p>

<p>Correlation can be enough in some settings <span class="citation" data-cites="hill1965environment">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-hill1965environment" role="doc-biblioref">Hill 1965</a>)</span>, but to be able to make forecasts when things change, and the circumstances are slightly different, we need to understand causation. Economics went through a credibility revolution in the 2000s <span class="citation" data-cites="angrist2010credibility">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-angrist2010credibility" role="doc-biblioref">Angrist and Pischke 2010</a>)</span>. During this time economists looked back on previous work and realized it was not as reliable as it could be. There was increased concern with research design and the use of experiments. This considerably increased use of experiments also happened in political science in the 2000s and 2010s <span class="citation" data-cites="Druckman2021">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Druckman2021" role="doc-biblioref">Druckman and Green 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The key is the counterfactual: what would have happened in the absence of the treatment. Ideally, we could keep everything else constant, randomly divide the world into two groups, and treat one and not the other. Then we could be pretty confident that any difference between the two groups was due to that treatment. The reason for this is that if we have some population and we randomly select two groups from it, then our two groups (provided they are both big enough) should have the same characteristics as the population. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and A/B testing attempt to get us as close to this “gold standard” as we can hope.</p>
<p>When we, and others such as <span class="citation" data-cites="athey2017state">Athey and Imbens (<a href="99-references.html#ref-athey2017state" role="doc-biblioref">2017b</a>)</span>, use such positive language to refer to these approaches, we do not mean to imply that they are perfect. Just that they can be better than most of the other options. For instance, in <a href="14-causality_from_obs.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;14</span></a> we will consider causality from observational data, and while this is sometimes all that we can do, the circumstances in which it is possible to evaluate both makes it clear that approaches based on observational data are usually second-best <span class="citation" data-cites="Gordon2019 closeenoughaintgoodenough">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Gordon2019" role="doc-biblioref">Gordon et al. 2019</a>; <a href="99-references.html#ref-closeenoughaintgoodenough" role="doc-biblioref">Gordon, Moakler, and Zettelmeyer 2022</a>)</span>. RCTs and A/B testing also bring other benefits, such as being able to design a study that focuses on a particular question and tries to uncover the mechanism by which the effect occurs <span class="citation" data-cites="alsan2021beyond">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-alsan2021beyond" role="doc-biblioref">Alsan and Finkelstein 2021</a>)</span>. But they are not perfect, and the embrace of RCTs has not been unanimous <span class="citation" data-cites="Deaton2010">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Deaton2010" role="doc-biblioref">Deaton 2010</a>)</span>. One bedrock of experimental practice is that it be blinded, that is, a participant does not know whether they are in the treatment or control group. A failure to blind, especially with subjective outcomes is grounds for the dismissal of an entire experiment <span class="citation" data-cites="blindpace">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-blindpace" role="doc-biblioref">Edwards 2017</a>)</span>. And ideally experiments are double-blind, that is, even the researcher does not know. <span class="citation" data-cites="stolberg2006inventing">Stolberg (<a href="99-references.html#ref-stolberg2006inventing" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> discusses an early example of a randomized double-blind trial in 1835 to evaluate the effect of homeopathic drugs where neither the participants nor the organizers knew who was in which group. This is rarely the case for RCTs and A/B testing. Again, this is not to say they are not useful, after all in 1847 Semmelweis identified the benefit of having an intern wash their hands before delivering babies without a blinded study <span class="citation" data-cites="morange">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-morange" role="doc-biblioref">Morange 2016, 121</a>)</span>. Another major concern is with the extent to which the result found in the RCT generalizes to outside of that setting. Finally, there are typically few RCTs conducted over a long time, although it is possible this is changing and <span class="citation" data-cites="Bouguen2019">Bouguen et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-Bouguen2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> provide a large number of RCTs that could be followed up on to assess long-term effects.</p>
<p>We hope to be able to establish treatment and control groups that are the same, but for the treatment. This means that establishing the control group is critical because when we do that, we establish the counterfactual. We might be worried about, say, underlying trends, which is one issue with a before-and-after comparison, or selection bias, which could occur when we allow self-selection into the treatment group. Either of these issues could result in biased estimates. We use randomization to go some way to addressing these.</p>
<p>To get started, we simulate a population, and then randomly sample from it. We will set it up so that half the population likes blue, and the other half likes white. And further, if someone likes blue then they almost surely prefer dogs, but if they like white then they almost surely prefer cats. The approach of heavily using simulation is a critical part of the workflow advocated in this book. This is because we know roughly what the outcomes should be from the analysis of simulated data. Whereas if we go straight to analyzing the real data, then we do not know if unexpected outcomes are due to our own analysis errors, or actual results. Another good reason it is useful to take this approach of simulation is that when you are working in teams the analysis can get started before the data collection and cleaning is completed. The simulation will also help the collection and cleaning team think about tests they should run on their data.</p>

<p>It is exciting to have a representative share on “unobservables” (In this case, we do “observe” them—to illustrate the point—but we did not select on them). We get this because the variables were correlated. But it will break down in several ways that we will discuss. It also assumes large enough groups. For instance, if we considered specific dog breeds, instead of dogs as an entity, we may not find ourselves in this situation. To check that the two groups are the same, we look to see if we can identify a difference between the two groups based on observables, theory, experience, and expert opinion. In this case we looked at the mean, but we could look at other aspects as well.</p>
<p>This would traditionally bring us to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA was introduced around 100 years ago by Fisher while he was working on statistical problems in agriculture. (<span class="citation" data-cites="Stolley1991">Stolley (<a href="99-references.html#ref-Stolley1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span> provides additional interesting background on Fisher.) This is less unexpected than it may seem because historically agricultural research was closely tied to statistical innovation. Often statistical methods were designed to answer agricultural questions such as “does fertilizer work?” and were only later adapted to clinical trials <span class="citation" data-cites="yoshioka1998use">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-yoshioka1998use" role="doc-biblioref">Yoshioka 1998</a>)</span>. It was relatively easily to divide a field into “treated” and “non-treated”, and the magnitude of any effect was likely to be large. While appropriate for that context, often these same statistical approaches are still taught today in introductory material, even when they are being applied to different circumstances to those they were designed for. For instance, these days, many researchers worry more about data quantity than data quality, and effect sizes may be small, which creates issues for these approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="Bradley2021">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Bradley2021" role="doc-biblioref">Bradley et al. 2021</a>)</span>. It almost always pays to take a step back and think about what is being done and whether it is appropriate to these circumstances. We mention ANOVA here because of its importance historically, but it is a variant of linear regression and, in general, we would usually not directly use ANOVA day-to-day these days. There is nothing wrong with it in the right circumstances. But it is more than 100 years old and the number of modern use-cases where it is the best option is small. A better option, in many cases, would be to actually build the model that underpins it ourselves, which we cover in <a href="12-ijalm.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a>.</p>

<p>If the treated and control groups are the same in all ways and remain that way, but for the treatment, then we have internal validity, which is to say that our control will work as a counterfactual and our results can speak to a difference between the groups in that study. Internal validity means that our estimates of the effect of the treatment speak to the treatment and not some other aspect. It means that we can use our results to make claims about what happened in the experiment.</p>
<p>If the group to which we applied our randomization were representative of the broader population, and the experimental set-up was like outside conditions, then we further could have external validity. That would mean that the difference that we find does not just apply in our own experiment, but also in the broader population. External validity means that we can use our experiment to make claims about what would happen outside the experiment. It is randomization that has allowed that to happen. It is worth noting that in practice we would not just rely on one experiment but would instead consider that a contribution to a broader evidence-collection effort <span class="citation" data-cites="Duflo2020">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Duflo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Duflo 2020, 1955</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>But this means we need randomization twice. Firstly, into the group that was subject to the experiment, and then secondly, between treatment and control. How do we think about this randomization, and to what extent does it matter?</p>
<p>We are interested in the effect of being treated. It may be that we charge different prices, which would be a continuous treatment variable, or that we compare different colors on a website, which would be a discrete treatment variable. Either way, we need to make sure that all the groups are otherwise the same. How can we be convinced of this? One way is to ignore the treatment variable and to examine all other variables, looking for whether we can detect a difference between the groups based on any other variables. For instance, if we are conducting an experiment on a website, then are the groups roughly similar in terms of, say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft and Apple users?</li>
<li>Safari, Chrome, and Firefox users?</li>
<li>Mobile and desktop users?</li>
<li>Users from certain locations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, are the groups representative of the broader population? These are all threats to the validity of our claims.</p>
<p>But if done properly, that is if the treatment is truly independent, then we can estimate the average treatment effect (ATE). In a binary treatment variable setting this is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mbox{ATE} = \mathbb{E}[Y|t=1] - \mathbb{E}[Y|t=0].\]</span></p>
<p>That is, the difference between the treated group, <span class="math inline">\(t = 1\)</span>, and the control group, <span class="math inline">\(t = 0\)</span>, when measured by the expected value of the outcome, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The ATE becomes the difference between the two conditional expectations.</p>
<p>To illustrate this concept, we first simulate some data that shows an average difference of one between the treatment and control groups.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is often a difference between simulated data and reality. For instance, an experiment cannot run for too long otherwise people may be treated many times or become inured to the treatment; but it cannot be too short otherwise we cannot measure longer-term outcomes. We cannot have a “representative” sample across every facet of a population, but if not, then the treatment and control may be different. Practical difficulties may make it difficult to follow up with certain groups and so we end up with a biased collection. Some questions to explore when working with real experimental data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are the participants being selected into the frame for consideration?</li>
<li>How are they being selected for treatment? We would hope this is being done randomly, but this term is applied to a variety of situations. Additionally, early “success” can lead to pressure to treat everyone, especially in medical settings.</li>
<li>How is treatment being assessed?</li>
<li>To what extent is random allocation ethical and fair? Some argue that shortages mean it is reasonable to randomly allocate, but that may depend on how linear the benefits are. It may also be difficult to establish definitions, and the power imbalance between those making these decisions and those being treated should be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bias and other issues are not the end of the world. But we need to think about them carefully. Selection bias, introduced in <a href="04-writing_research.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;4</span></a>, can be adjusted for, but only if it is recognized. For instance, how would the results of a survey about the difficulty of a university course differ if only students who completed the course were surveyed, and not those who dropped out? We should always work to try to make our dataset as representative as possible when we are creating it, but it may be possible to use a model to adjust for some of the bias <em>ex post</em>. For instance, if there were a variable that was correlated with, say, attrition, then it could be added to the model either by itself, or as an interaction. Similarly, if there was correlation between the individuals. For instance, if there was some “hidden variable” that we did not know about that meant some individuals were correlated, then we could use wider standard errors. This needs to be done carefully and we discuss this further in <a href="14-causality_from_obs.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;14</span></a>. That said, if such issues can be anticipated, then it can be better to change the experiment. For instance, perhaps it would be possible to stratify by that variable.</p>

<h3 data-number="8.2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fishers-tea-party"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.3</span> Fisher’s tea party</h3>
<p>The British are funny when it comes to tea. There is substantial, persistent, debate in the United Kingdom about how to make the perfect “cuppa” with everyone from George Orwell to John Lennon weighing in. Some say to add the milk first. Others, to add it last. YouGov, a polling company, found that most respondents put milk in last <span class="citation" data-cites="yougovforthedefence">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-yougovforthedefence" role="doc-biblioref">Smith 2018</a>)</span>. But one might wonder whether the order matters at all.</p>
<p>Fisher introduced an experiment designed to see if a person can distinguish between a cup of tea where the milk was added first, or last. We begin by preparing eight cups of tea: four with milk added first and the other four with milk added last. We then randomize the order of all eight cups. We tell the taster, whom we will call “Ian”, about the experimental set-up: there are eight cups of tea, four of each type, he will be given cups of tea in a random order, and his task is to group them into two groups.</p>
<p>One of the nice aspects of this experiment is that we can do it ourselves. There are a few things to be careful of in practice, including that the quantities of milk and tea are consistent, the groups are marked in some way that the taster cannot see, and the order is randomized.</p>
<p>Another nice aspect of this experiment is that we can calculate the chance that Ian is able to randomly get the groupings correct. To decide if his groupings were likely to have occurred at random, we need to calculate the probability this could happen. First, we count the number of successes out of the four that were chosen. There are: <span class="math inline">\({8 \choose 4} = \frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!}=70\)</span> possible outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="fisherdesignofexperiments">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-fisherdesignofexperiments" role="doc-biblioref">Fisher 1949, 14</a>)</span>. This notation means there are eight items in the set, and we are choosing four of them, and is used when the order of choice does not matter.</p>
<p>We are asking Ian to group the cups, not to identify which is which, and so there are two ways for him to be perfectly correct. He could either correctly identify all the ones that were milk-first (one outcome out of 70) or correctly identify all the ones that were tea-first (one outcome out of 70). This means the probability of this event is: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{70} \approx 0.028\)</span> or about three per cent.</p>
<p>As <span class="citation" data-cites="fisherdesignofexperiments">Fisher (<a href="99-references.html#ref-fisherdesignofexperiments" role="doc-biblioref">1949, 15</a>)</span> makes clear, this now becomes a judgement call. We need to consider the weight of evidence that we require before we accept the groupings did not occur by chance and that Ian was well aware of what he was doing. We need to decide what evidence it takes for us to be convinced. If there is no possible evidence that would dissuade us from the view that we held coming into the experiment, say, that there is no difference between milk-first and tea-first, then what is the point of doing an experiment? We expect that if Ian got it completely right, then the reasonable person would accept that he was able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>What if he is almost perfect? By chance, there are 16 ways for a person to be “off-by-one”. Either Ian thinks there was one cup that was milk-first when it was tea-first—there are, <span class="math inline">\({4 \choose 1} = 4\)</span>, four ways this could happen—or he thinks there was one cup that was tea-first when it was milk-first—again, there are, <span class="math inline">\({4 \choose 1}\)</span> = 4, four ways this could happen. These outcomes are independent, so the probability is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4\times 4}{70} \approx 0.228\)</span>. And so on. Given there is an almost 23 per cent chance of being off-by-one just by randomly grouping the teacups, this outcome probably would not convince us that Ian can tell the difference between tea-first and milk-first.</p>
<p>What we are looking for, in order to claim something is experimentally demonstrable is the results of not just it being shown once, but instead to come to know the features of an experiment where such a result is reliably found <span class="citation" data-cites="fisherdesignofexperiments">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-fisherdesignofexperiments" role="doc-biblioref">Fisher 1949, 16</a>)</span>. We are looking to thoroughly interrogate our data and our experiments, and to think precisely about the analysis methods we are using. Rather than searching for meaning in constellations of stars, we want to make it as easy as possible for others to reproduce our work. It is only in that way that our conclusions stand a chance of holding up in the long term.</p>

<p>One of the foundations of ethical experimental practice is informed consent and ensuring that an experiment is actually needed. We now detail two cases where human life was potentially lost to remind us of the importance of these foundations. One issue with experiments in medical settings is that the weight of evidence is measured in lost lives. Ethical practice in experiments develops because of the many people who may have unnecessarily lost their lives. Two cases that have dramatically informed practice are the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the ECMO experiments.</p>
<p>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study is an infamous medical trial that began in 1932. As part of this experiment, 400 Black Americans with syphilis were not given appropriate treatment, nor even told they had syphilis, well after a standard treatment for syphilis was established and widely available <span class="citation" data-cites="brandt1978racism tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-brandt1978racism" role="doc-biblioref">Brandt 1978</a>; <a href="99-references.html#ref-tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen" role="doc-biblioref">Alsan and Wanamaker 2018</a>)</span>. A control group, without syphilis, were also given non-effective drugs. These financially poor Black Americans in the US South were offered minimal compensation and not told they were part of an experiment <span class="citation" data-cites="brandt1978racism tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-brandt1978racism" role="doc-biblioref">Brandt 1978</a>; <a href="99-references.html#ref-tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen" role="doc-biblioref">Alsan and Wanamaker 2018</a>)</span>. Further, extensive work was undertaken to ensure the men would not receive treatment from anywhere, including writing to local doctors and the local health department. Incredibly, after some of the men were drafted and told to immediately get treatment, the draft board complied with a request to have the men excluded from treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="brandt1978racism">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-brandt1978racism" role="doc-biblioref">Brandt 1978, 25</a>)</span>. By the time the study was stopped in 1972, more than half of the men were deceased and many of deaths were from syphilis-related causes <span class="citation" data-cites="tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen" role="doc-biblioref">Alsan and Wanamaker 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The effect of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study was felt not just by the men in the study, but more broadly. <span class="citation" data-cites="tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen">Alsan and Wanamaker (<a href="99-references.html#ref-tuskegeeandthehealthofblackmen" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> found that it is associated with a decrease in life expectancy at age 45 of up to 1.5 years for Black men located around central Alabama. They show that this is because of medical mistrust and decreased physician interactions.

<p>Turning to the evaluation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), <span class="citation" data-cites="ware1989investigating">Ware (<a href="99-references.html#ref-ware1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> describes how they viewed ECMO as a possible treatment for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns. They enrolled 19 patients and used conventional medical therapy on ten of them, and ECMO on nine of them. It was found that six of the ten in the control group survived while all in the treatment group survived. <span class="citation" data-cites="ware1989investigating">Ware (<a href="99-references.html#ref-ware1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> used randomized consent whereby only the parents of infants randomly selected to be treated with ECMO were asked to consent.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="ware1989investigating">Ware (<a href="99-references.html#ref-ware1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> is concerned with “equipoise”, by which they refer to a situation in which there is genuine uncertainty about whether the treatment is more effective than existing procedures. They further note that in medical settings even if there is initial equipoise it could be undermined if the treatment is found to be effective early in the study. <span class="citation" data-cites="ware1989investigating">Ware (<a href="99-references.html#ref-ware1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> describes how after the results of these first 19 patients, randomization stopped and only ECMO was used. The recruiters and those treating the patients were initially not told that randomization had stopped. It was decided that this complete allocation to ECMO would continue “until either the 28th survivor or the 4th death was observed”. After 19 of 20 additional patients survived the trial was terminated. So, the actual result of the experiment was divided into two phases: in the first there was randomized use of ECMO, and in the second only ECMO was used.</p>
<p>One approach in these settings is a “randomized play-the-winner” rule following <span class="citation" data-cites="wei1978randomized">Wei and Durham (<a href="99-references.html#ref-wei1978randomized" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>. Treatment is still randomized, but the weight of probability shifts with each successful treatment to make treatment more likely, and there is some stopping rule. But <span class="citation" data-cites="berry1989investigating">Berry (<a href="99-references.html#ref-berry1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> argues that far from the need for a more sophisticated stopping rule, there was no need for the study because equipoise never existed. <span class="citation" data-cites="berry1989investigating">Berry (<a href="99-references.html#ref-berry1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> re-visits the literature mentioned by <span class="citation" data-cites="ware1989investigating">Ware (<a href="99-references.html#ref-ware1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> and finds extensive evidence that ECMO was known to be effective. <span class="citation" data-cites="berry1989investigating">Berry (<a href="99-references.html#ref-berry1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> points out that there is almost never complete consensus and so one could almost always argue, inappropriately, for the existence of equipoise even in the face of a substantial weight of evidence. <span class="citation" data-cites="berry1989investigating">Berry (<a href="99-references.html#ref-berry1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> further criticizes <span class="citation" data-cites="ware1989investigating">Ware (<a href="99-references.html#ref-ware1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> for the use of randomized consent because of the potential that there may have been different outcomes for the infants subject to conventional therapy had their parents known there were other options. And instead, <span class="citation" data-cites="berry1989investigating">Berry (<a href="99-references.html#ref-berry1989investigating" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> argues for the need for comprehensive patient registries, enabling the analysis of large datasets.</p>
<p>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and ECMO experiments may seem quite far from our present circumstances. While it may be illegal to do this exact research these days, it does not mean that unethical research does not still happen. For instance, we see it in machine learning applications in health and other areas; while we are not meant to explicitly discriminate and we are meant to get consent, it does not mean that we cannot implicitly discriminate without any type of buy-in at all. For instance, <span class="citation" data-cites="obermeyer2019dissecting">Obermeyer et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-obermeyer2019dissecting" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> describes how US health care systems use algorithms to score the severity of how sick the patient is. They show that for the same score, Black patients are sicker, and that if Black patients were scored in the same way as White patients, then they would receive considerably more care. They find that the discrimination occurs because the algorithm is based on health care costs, rather than sickness. But because access to healthcare is unequally distributed between Black and White patients, the algorithm, however inadvertently, perpetuates racial bias.</p>

<section id="surveys" class="level2" data-number="8.3">
<h2 data-number="8.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surveys"><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Surveys</h2>
<p>Having decided what to measure, one common way to get values is to use a survey. This is especially challenging, and there is an entire field, survey research, focused on this. <span class="citation" data-cites="Edelman2021Interview">Edelman, Vittert, and Meng (<a href="99-references.html#ref-Edelman2021Interview" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> make it clear that there are no new problems here, and the challenges that we face today are closely related to those that were faced in the past. There are many ways to implement surveys, and this decision matters. For some time, the only option was face-to-face surveys, where an enumerator would be tasked with conducting the survey with a respondent. Eventually surveys began to be conducted over the telephone, again by an enumerator. One issue is that it was found that in both these settings there were considerable interviewer effects <span class="citation" data-cites="anchoringmethod">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-anchoringmethod" role="doc-biblioref">Elliott et al. 2022</a>)</span>. The internet brought a third era of survey research, characterized by low participation rates and increased options for data collection <span class="citation" data-cites="Groves2011">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Groves2011" role="doc-biblioref">Groves 2011</a>)</span>. The use of surveys remains popular and an invaluable way to get data. While face-to-face and telephone surveys are still used and have an important role to play, we now focus on designing internet based surveys and introduce one way to implement them.</p>
<p>We focus on internet based surveys. There are many dedicated survey platforms, such as Survey Monkey and Qualtrics, that are largely internet-based. In general, the focus of those platforms is on putting together the survey form and they expect that we already have contact details for the sample of interest. Some other platforms, such as Mechanical Turk and Prolific, focus on providing that audience, and we can then ask that audience to do more than just take a survey. When using platforms like those, and other providers, it is vital to be aware of who is in the sample <span class="citation" data-cites="Levay2016 whereyoursurveycomesfrom">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Levay2016" role="doc-biblioref">Levay, Freese, and Druckman 2016</a>; <a href="99-references.html#ref-whereyoursurveycomesfrom" role="doc-biblioref">Enns and Rothschild 2022</a>)</span>. While it is a useful feature, it usually comes with higher costs. Finally, platforms such as Facebook also provide the ability to run a survey. One especially common approach, because it is free, is to use Google Forms.</p>
<p>The survey form needs to be considered within the context of the broader research and with special concern for the respondent. The most important aspect is to test the survey before releasing it more broadly. <span class="citation" data-cites="bydesignplanningresearch">Light, Singer, and Willett (<a href="99-references.html#ref-bydesignplanningresearch" role="doc-biblioref">1990, 213</a>)</span>, talking about running pilot studies to evaluate higher education, say that there is no occasion in which a pilot will not bring improvements, and that they are almost always worth it. In the case of surveys, we go further and say that the fundamental rule of surveys is that if you do not have time, or budget, to test the survey, then do not bother doing the survey. The wording of a survey is crucial <span class="citation" data-cites="tourangeau2000">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-tourangeau2000" role="doc-biblioref">Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski 2000, 23</a>)</span>. When designing the survey, we need to have survey questions that are conversational and flow from one to the next, grouped within topics <span class="citation" data-cites="elson2016question">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-elson2016question" role="doc-biblioref">Elson 2018</a>)</span>. But we should also consider the cognitive load that we place on the respondent, and vary the difficulty of the questions.</p>
<p>When designing a survey, the critical task is to keep the respondent front-of-mind <span class="citation" data-cites="surveystailored">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-surveystailored" role="doc-biblioref">Dillman, Smyth, and Christian 2014, 94</a>)</span>. Drawing on <span class="citation" data-cites="surveydesign">Swain (<a href="99-references.html#ref-surveydesign" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>, all questions need to be relevant and able to be answered by the respondent. The wording of the questions should be based on what the respondent would be comfortable with. The decision between different question types turns on minimizing error and the burden that we impose on the respondent. In general, if there are a small number of clear options then multiple-choice questions are appropriate. In that case, the responses should usually be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. If they are not mutually exclusive, then this needs to be signaled in the text of the question. It is also important that units are specified, and that standard concepts are used, to the extent possible.</p>
<p>Open text boxes may be appropriate if there are a lot of potential answers, although this will increase the time the respondent spends completing the survey and increase the time it will take to analyze the answers. Only ask one question at a time and make sure that questions are asked in a neutral way that does not lead to one particular response. We want to avoid ambiguous or double-barreled questions. The subject matter of the survey will also affect the appropriate choice of question type. For instance, potentially “threatening” topics may be better considered with open-ended questions <span class="citation" data-cites="blair1977ask">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-blair1977ask" role="doc-biblioref">Blair et al. 1977</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>All surveys need to have an introduction that specifies a title for the survey, who is conducting it, their contact details, and the purpose. It should also include a statement about protecting confidentiality and ethics review board permission, if appropriate.</p>
<p>When doing surveys, it is critical to ask the right person. For instance, <span class="citation" data-cites="Lichand2022">Lichand and Wolf (<a href="99-references.html#ref-Lichand2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> consider child labor, the extent of which is typically based on surveys of parents. When questions were instead asked of children themselves, a considerable under-reporting by parents was found. Finally, one especially exciting area of research is making better use of surveys delivered on smartphones. In particular, using voice, rather than text, to allow open-ended survey questions. <span class="citation" data-cites="gavras2022innovating">Gavras et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-gavras2022innovating" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> find that collecting voice responses in this way, compared with typed answers, is associated with responses that are more “intuitive and spontaneous”.</p>
<p>One aspect of particular concern is questions about sexual orientation and gender identify. While this is an evolving area, <span class="citation" data-cites="whitehousebestpractice">The White House (<a href="99-references.html#ref-whitehousebestpractice" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> provides recommendations for best practice, such as considering how the data will be used, and ensuring sufficient sample size. With regard to asking about sexual orientation they recommend: “Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?” with possible answers: “Gay or lesbian”; “Straight, that is not gay or lesbian”; “Bisexual”; “I use a different term [free-text]”; “I don’t know”. And with regard to gender, they recommend a multi-question approach. First, “What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?” with possible answers: “Female”; and “Male”. Then, “How do you currently describe yourself (mark all that apply)?” “Female”; “Male”; “Transgender”; and “I use a different term [free-text]”. And finally, “Just to confirm, you were assigned {FILL} at birth and now you describe yourself as {FILL}. Is that correct?” with possible answers: “Yes”; and “No”.</p>
<p>Finally, returning to the reason for doing surveys in the first place, while doing all this, it is important to also keep what we are interested in measuring in mind.</p>

<p>Dr Amy Finkelstein is John &amp; Jennie S. Macdonald Professor Of Economics at at MIT. After earning a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2001, she was a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows, before returning to MIT as an assistant professor in 2005, being promoted to full professor in 2008. One area of her research is health economics and she uses randomized controlled trials to understand health insurance. She was one of the lead researchers on <span class="citation" data-cites="finkelstein2012oregon">Finkelstein et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-finkelstein2012oregon" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. She was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal in 2012 and a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2018.</p>

<p>Oregon funded 10,000 places in the state-run Medicaid program, which provides health insurance for people with low incomes. A lottery was used to allocate these places, and this was judged fair because it was expected, correctly as it turned out, that demand for places would exceed the supply. In the end, 89,824 individuals signed up.</p>
<p>The draws were conducted over a six-month period and 35,169 individuals were selected (the household of those who won the draw were given the opportunity) but only 30 per cent of them turned out to be eligible and completed the paperwork. The insurance lasted indefinitely. This random allocation of insurance allowed the researchers to understand the effect of health insurance.</p>
<p>The reason that this random allocation is important is that it is not usually possible to compare those with and without insurance because the type of people that sign up to get health insurance differ to those who do not. That decision is “confounded” with other variables and results in selection bias.</p>
<p>As the opportunity to apply for health insurance was randomly allocated, the researchers were able to evaluate the health and earnings of those who received health insurance and compare them to those who did not. To do this they used administrative data, such as hospital discharge data, matched credit reports, and, uncommonly, mortality records. This collection of data is limited, and so they included a survey conducted by mail.</p>
<p>The specifics of this are not important, and we will have more to say in <a href="12-ijalm.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a>, but they used a statistical model, <a href="#eq-oregon">Equation&nbsp;<span>8.1</span></a>, to analyze the results <span class="citation" data-cites="finkelstein2012oregon">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-finkelstein2012oregon" role="doc-biblioref">Finkelstein et al. 2012</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-oregon"><span class="math display">\[
y_{ihj} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\mbox{Lottery} + X_{ih}\beta_2 + V_{ih}\beta_3 + \epsilon_{ihj}
\tag{8.1}\]</span></span></p>
<p><a href="#eq-oregon">Equation&nbsp;<span>8.1</span></a> explains various <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> outcomes (such as health) for an individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in household <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> as a function of an indicator variable as to whether household <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> was selected by the lottery. Hence, it is the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> coefficient that is of particular interest. That is our estimate of the mean difference between the treatment and control groups. To complete the specification of <a href="#eq-oregon">Equation&nbsp;<span>8.1</span></a>, <span class="math inline">\(X_{ih}\)</span> is a set of variables that are correlated with the probability of being treated. These adjust for that impact to a certain extent. An example of that is the number of individuals in a household. And finally, <span class="math inline">\(V_{ih}\)</span> is a set of variables that are not correlated with the lottery. These variables include demographics, hospital discharge, and lottery draw.</p>
<p>Like earlier studies such as <span class="citation" data-cites="randhealth">Brook et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-randhealth" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="finkelstein2012oregon">Finkelstein et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-finkelstein2012oregon" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> found that the treatment group used more health care including both primary and preventive care as well as hospitalizations but had lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures. More generally, the treatment group reported better physical and mental health.</p>
<!-- ### Student Coaching: How Far Can Technology Go? -->
<!-- There is a general concern about students dropping out of university before they finish their degree. If you work one-on-one with a student then this addresses the issue. But that does not scale. The point of this experiment was to see if technology-based options could be more efficient. The focus was the University of Toronto, and in particular first-year economics courses in Fall 2015. -->
<!-- The intervention was administered to students as part of an economics class. Students received 2 per cent of their grade for completing the exercise. The specific exercise depended on the group of the student. The intervention involved three treatments as well as a control group that was just given a Big Five personality traits test. Additional information that was obtained included 'the highest level of education obtained by students’ parents, the amount of education they expect to obtain, whether they are first-year or international students, and their work and study time plans for the upcoming year.' [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 6]. -->
<!-- The treatments were [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 4]: -->
<!-- 1. '[A] one-time, online exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the fall'. This exercise was 'designed to get them thinking about the future they envision and the steps they could take in the upcoming year at U of T to help make that future a reality. They were told that the exercise was designed for their benefit and to take their time while completing it. The online module lasted approximately 60 to 90 minutes and led students through a series of writing exercises in which they wrote about their ideal futures, both at work and at home, what they would like to accomplish in the current year at U of T, how they intend on following certain study strategies to meet their goals, and whether they want to get involved with extracurricular activities at the university' [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 6]. -->
<!-- 2. '[T]he online intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic year'. This involved the students being given 'the opportunity to provide their phone numbers and participate in a text and email messaging campaign lasting throughout both the fall semester in 2015 and the winter semester in 2016' [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 8]. All students in this group got the emails, but only those that provided phone numbers got the messages. They were able to opt out, but 'few chose to do so' [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 8]. This was a two-way interaction in which students could ask questions. Some asked for the 'locations of certain facilities on campus or how to stay on residence during the holiday break, while others said they need help with English skills or specific courses. Some students expressed relatively deep emotions, such as feeling anxious about family pressure to succeed in school or from doing poorly on an evaluation' [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 9]. A response was usually given within an hour. -->
<!-- 3. '[T]he online intervention plus one-on-one coaching in which students are assigned to upper-year undergraduate coaches'. 'Coaches were available to meet with students to answer any questions via Skype, phone, or in person, and would send their students regular text and email messages of advice, encouragement, and motivation, much like the You@UofT program described above. In contrast to the messaging program, however, coaches were instructed to be proactive and regularly monitor their students’ progress. Whereas the You@UofT program attempts to “nudge” students in the right direction with academic advice, coaches play a greater “support” role, sensitively guiding students through problems.' [@Oreopoulos2018, p. 11]. This coaching program was only available at UTM. 'Our coaching treatment group was established by randomly drawing twenty-four students from the group of students that were randomly assigned into the text message campaign treatment. At the conclusion of the online exercise, instead of being invited to provide a phone number for the purpose of receiving text messages, these twenty-four students were given the opportunity to participate in a pilot coaching program. A total of seventeen students agreed to participate in the coaching program, while seven students declined.' -->

The main parameters of interest are $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$. The main outcomes were course grades, GPA, credits earned and failed. -->

<!-- It was found, that the one-on-one coaching 'increased grades by approximately 5 percentage points', while the other treatments had 'had no detectable impact'. One set of results are summarised in @fig-torontointervention). -->

<p>Trust is not something that we think regularly about, but it is fairly fundamental to most interactions, both economic and personal. For instance, many of us get paid after we do some work–we are trusting our employer will make good, and vice versa. If you get paid in advance, then they are trusting you. In a strictly naive, one-shot, world without transaction costs, this does not make sense. If you get paid in advance, the incentive is for you to take the money and run in the last pay period before you quit, and through backward induction everything falls apart. We do not live in such a world. For one thing there are transaction costs, for another, generally, we have repeated interactions, and finally, the world usually ends up being fairly small.</p>
<p>Understanding the extent of honesty in different countries may help us to explain economic development and other aspects of interest such as tax compliance, but it is hard to measure.

Importantly, for the experiment, they usually have a reception area where the wallet could be turned in <span class="citation" data-cites="cohn2019civic">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-cohn2019civic" role="doc-biblioref">Cohn et al. 2019a, 1</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the experiment a research assistant turned in the wallet to an employee at the reception area, using a set form of words. The research assistant had to note various features of the setting, such as the gender, age-group, and busyness of the “recipient”. The wallets were transparent and contained a key, a grocery list, and a business card with a name and email address. The outcome of interest was whether an email was sent to the unique email address on the business card in the wallet. The grocery list was included to signal that the owner of the wallet was a local. The key was included as something that was only useful to the owner of the wallet, and never the recipient, in contrast to the cash, to adjust for altruism. The language and currency were adapted to local conditions.</p>
<p>The primary treatment in the experiment is whether the wallet contained money or not. The key outcome was whether the wallet was attempted to be returned or not. It was found that the median response time was 26 minutes, and that if an email was sent then it usually happened within a day <span class="citation" data-cites="cohn2019civicaddendum">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-cohn2019civicaddendum" role="doc-biblioref">Cohn et al. 2019b, 10</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the data for the paper that is made available <span class="citation" data-cites="walletsdata">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-walletsdata" role="doc-biblioref">Cohn 2019</a>)</span> we can see that considerable differences were found between countries (<a href="#fig-wallets">Figure&nbsp;<span>8.2</span></a>). But in almost all countries wallets with money were more likely to be returned than wallets without. The experiments were conducted across 40 countries, which were chosen based on them having enough cities with populations of at least 100,000, as well as the ability for the research assistants to safely visit and withdraw cash. Within those countries, the cities were chosen starting with the largest ones and there were usually 400 observations in each country <span class="citation" data-cites="cohn2019civicaddendum">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-cohn2019civicaddendum" role="doc-biblioref">Cohn et al. 2019b, 5</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="cohn2019civic">Cohn et al.

<p>The past two decades have probably seen the most experiments ever run, likely by several orders of magnitude. This is because of the extensive use of A/B testing at tech firms <span class="citation" data-cites="Kohavi2012">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Kohavi2012" role="doc-biblioref">Kohavi et al. 2012</a>)</span> for many aspects and especially around push notifications <span class="citation" data-cites="boykisabtesting">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-boykisabtesting" role="doc-biblioref">Boykis 2022</a>)</span>. For a long time decisions such as what font to use were based on the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HIPPO) <span class="citation" data-cites="abtestswired">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-abtestswired" role="doc-biblioref">Christian 2012</a>)</span>. These days, many large tech companies have extensive infrastructure for experiments, and they term them A/B tests because of the comparison of two groups: one that gets treatment A and the other that either gets treatment B or does not see any change <span class="citation" data-cites="Salganik2018">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Salganik2018" role="doc-biblioref">Salganik 2018, 185</a>)</span>. We could additionally consider more than two options, in which we typically change to using the terminology of “arms” of the experiment.</p>
<p>The proliferation of experiments in the private sector has brought with it a host of ethical concerns. Some private companies do not have ethical review boards, and there are different ethical concerns in the private sector compared with academia. For instance, many A/B tests are designed, explicitly, to make a consumer more likely to spend money. While society may not have a concern, in general, with that in the case of an online grocery retailer, it may be that society would have a problem in the case of an online gambling website. More extensive legislation and the development of private-sector ethical best practice are both likely to be areas that receive more attention as the extent of experimentation in the private sector becomes better known.</p>

<p>Knowing the time is a critical aspect of running experiments on the internet. It is also critical in sports, for instance Formula 1 times laps to the thousandth of a second. Timing allows us to distinguish between outcomes even when the event does not happen concurrently. For instance, think back to the discussion of swimmers by <span class="citation" data-cites="chambliss1989mundanity">Chambliss (<a href="99-references.html#ref-chambliss1989mundanity" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> introduced in <a href="02-drinking_from_a_fire_hose.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;2</span></a>, and how this would be impossible without knowing how long each event took them. It is also critical in finance where we need market participants to agree on whether an asset is available for sale. But the answer to “What time is it?” is a difficult one to answer. The time, according to some individual, can be set to different sources, and so will be different depending on who you ask. Since the 1970s the definitive answer has been to use atomic time, which is consistent. A caesium second is defined by ‘9192 631 770 cycles of the hyperfine transition frequency in the ground state of caesium 133’ <span class="citation" data-cites="Levine2023">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Levine2023" role="doc-biblioref">Levine, Tavella, and Milton 2022, 4</a>)</span>. Clock synchronization is the process whereby different computers agree on what time it is. <span class="citation" data-cites="hopper2022">Hopper (<a href="99-references.html#ref-hopper2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> provides an overview of how the Network Time Protocol (NTP) <span class="citation" data-cites="mills1991internet">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-mills1991internet" role="doc-biblioref">Mills 1991</a>)</span> enables this and some of the difficulties that exist for computer networks to discover atomic time. Another measure of time is astronomical time, which is based on the rotation of the Earth. But because the Earth spins inconsistently and other issues, adjustments have been made to ensure atomic and astronomical time match. This has resulted in the inclusions of positive leap seconds, and the possibility of a negative leap second, which have created problems <span class="citation" data-cites="Levine2023">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Levine2023" role="doc-biblioref">Levine, Tavella, and Milton 2022</a>)</span>. As a result, at some point in the future astronomical and atomic time will be allowed to diverge <span class="citation" data-cites="Gibney2022 mitchell2022again">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Gibney2022" role="doc-biblioref">Gibney 2022</a>; <a href="99-references.html#ref-mitchell2022again" role="doc-biblioref">Mitchell 2022</a>)</span>, and the answer to “what time is it?” will become even more difficult to answer!</p>

<p>Every time you are online you are probably subject to tens, hundreds, or potentially thousands, of different A/B tests. This is especially the case if you use apps like TikTok. While, at their heart, they are just experiments that use sensors to measure data that need to be analyzed, they have many special features that are interesting in their own light. For instance, <span class="citation" data-cites="kohavi">Kohavi, Tang, and Xu (<a href="99-references.html#ref-kohavi" role="doc-biblioref">2020, 3</a>)</span> discuss the example of Microsoft’s search engine Bing. They used A/B testing to examine how to display an advertisement. Based on these tests, they ended up lengthening the title on the advertisement. They found this caused revenue to increase by 12 per cent, or around $100 million annually, without any significant trade-off being measured. That all said, sometimes the hardest part of A/B testing is ensuring design enables suitable randomness, rather than the actual calculation of ATE.</p>
<p>We use the term A/B test to strictly refer to the situation in which we are primarily implementing an experiment through a technology stack about something that is primarily of the internet, for instance a change to a website or similar and measured with sensors rather than a survey. While at their heart they are just experiments, A/B testing has a range of specific concerns, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Bosch2022">Bosch and Revilla (<a href="99-references.html#ref-Bosch2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> detail some from a statistical perspective. There is something different about doing tens of thousands of small experiments all the time, compared with the RCT set-up of conducting one experiment over the course of months.</p>
<p>RCTs are often, though not exclusively, done in academia or by government agencies, but much of A/B testing occurs in industry. This means that if you are in industry and want to introduce A/B testing to your firm there can be aspects such as culture, relationship building, and nuance that become important. It can be difficult to convince a manager to run an experiment. Indeed, sometimes it can be easier to experiment by not delivering, or delaying, a change that has been decided to create a control group rather than a treatment group <span class="citation" data-cites="Salganik2018">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Salganik2018" role="doc-biblioref">Salganik 2018, 188</a>)</span>. This may especially be the case where there is a particularly incorrigible HIPPO. Sometimes the most difficult aspect of A/B testing, and conducting experiments more generally, is not the statistics, it is the politics. This is not unique to A/B testing and looking at the history of biology, we see that even aspects such as germ theory were not resolved through experiment, but instead on ideology and/or social standing <span class="citation" data-cites="morange">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-morange" role="doc-biblioref">Morange 2016, 124</a>)</span>, that is to say, politics.</p>
<p>When conducting A/B testing, as with all experiments, we need to be concerned with delivery. In the case of an experiment, it is usually clear how it is being delivered. For instance, we may have the person come to a doctor’s clinic and then inject them with either a drug or a placebo. But in the case of A/B testing, it is less obvious. For instance, should it be run “server-side”, meaning to make a change to a website, or “client-side”, meaning to change an app <span class="citation" data-cites="kohavi">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-kohavi" role="doc-biblioref">Kohavi, Tang, and Xu 2020, 153</a>)</span>. This decision affects our ability to both conduct the experiment and to gather data from it. <span class="citation" data-cites="netflixabtesting">Urban, Sreenivasan, and Kannan (<a href="99-references.html#ref-netflixabtesting" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> provide an overview of where A/B testing fits into Netflix workflow, assuming an app is installed on a PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>In the case of the effect of conducting the experiment, it is relatively easy and normal to update a website all the time. This means that small changes can be easily implemented if the experiment is conducted server-side. But in the case of a client-side implementation of an app, conducting an experiment becomes a bigger deal. For instance, the release may need to go through an app store, and so would need to be part of a regular release cycle. There is also a selection concern because some users will not update their app and there is the possibility that they are different to those that do regularly update the app.</p>
<p>Now we turn to the effect of the delivery decision on our ability to gather data from the experiment. Again, server-side is less of a big deal because we get the data anyway as part of the user interacting with the website. But in the case of an app, the user may use the app offline or with limited data upload, which then requires a data transmission protocol or caching, but this then could affect user experience, especially as some phones place limits on various aspects.</p>
<p>The effect of all this is that we need to plan. For instance, results are unlikely to be available the day after a change to an app, whereas they are likely available the day after a change to a website. Further, we may need to consider our results in the context of different devices and platforms, potentially using, say, regression which will be covered in <a href="12-ijalm.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a>.</p>
<p>The second aspect of concern is instrumentation. When we conduct a traditional experiment then we might, for instance, ask respondents to fill out a survey. But this is usually not done with A/B testing, and we usually use various sensors <span class="citation" data-cites="kohavi">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-kohavi" role="doc-biblioref">Kohavi, Tang, and Xu 2020, 162</a>)</span>. One approach is to put a cookie on the user’s device, but different users will clear these at different rates. Another approach is to use a beacon, such as forcing the user to download a tiny image from a server, so that we know when they have completed some action. For instance, this is a commonly used approach to know when a user has opened an email. There are practical concerns around when the beacon loads, for instance, if it is before the main content loads then the user experience may be worse, but if it is after then our sample may be biased.</p>
<p>The third aspect of concern is what are we randomizing over <span class="citation" data-cites="kohavi">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-kohavi" role="doc-biblioref">Kohavi, Tang, and Xu 2020, 166</a>)</span>? In the case of traditional experiments, this is usually clear and it is often a person, or sometimes various groups of people. But in the case of A/B testing it can be less clear. For instance, are we randomizing over the page, the session, or the user?</p>
<p>To think about this, let us consider color. For instance, say we are interested in whether we should change our logo from red to blue on the homepage. If we are randomizing at the page level, then if the user goes to some other page of our website, and then back to the homepage the logo could switch between colors. If we are randomizing at the session level, then while it could be blue while they use the website this time, if they close it and come back then it could be red. Finally, if we are randomizing at a user level then possibly it would always be red for one user, but always blue for another.</p>
<p>The extent to which this matters depends on a trade-off between consistency and importance. For instance, if we are A/B testing product prices then consistency is likely a feature. But if we are A/B testing background colors then consistency might not be as important. On the other hand, if we are A/B testing the position of a log-in button then it might be important that we not move that around too much for the one user, but between users it might matter less.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in A/B testing, as in traditional experiments, we are concerned that our treatment and control groups are the same, but for the treatment. In the case of traditional experiments, we satisfy ourselves of this by conducting analysis based on the data that we have after the experiment is conducted. That is usually all we can do because it would be weird to treat or control both groups. But in the case of A/B testing, the pace of experimentation allows us to randomly create the treatment and control groups, and then check, before we subject the treatment group to the treatment, that the groups are the same. For instance, if we were to show each group the same website, then we would expect the same outcomes across the two groups. If we found different outcomes then we would know that we may have a randomization issue <span class="citation" data-cites="taddy2019">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-taddy2019" role="doc-biblioref">Taddy 2019, 129</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects of A/B testing is that we are usually running them not because we desperately care about the specific outcome, but because that feeds into some other measure that we care about. For instance, do we care whether the website is quite-dark-blue or slightly-dark-blue? Probably not, but we probably care a lot about the company share price. But then what if picking the best blue comes at a cost to the share price?</p>
<p>To illustrate this, pretend that we work at a food delivery app, and we are concerned with driver retention. Say we do some A/B tests and find that drivers are always more likely to be retained when they can deliver food to the customer faster. Our finding is that faster is better, for driver retention, always. But one way to achieve faster deliveries is for them to not put the food into a hot box that would maintain the food’s temperature. Something like that might save 30 seconds, which is significant on a ten-15-minute delivery. Unfortunately, although we would decide to encourage that based on A/B tests designed to optimize driver-retention, such a decision would likely make the customer experience worse. If customers receive cold food when it is meant to be hot, then they may stop using the app, which would ultimately be very bad for the business. <span class="citation" data-cites="fbdiscoverslongterm">Chen et al. (<a href="99-references.html#ref-fbdiscoverslongterm" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> describe how they found a similar situation at Facebook in terms of notifications—although reducing the number of notifications reduced user engagement in the short-term, over the long-term it increased both user satisfaction and app usage.</p>
<p>This trade-off may be obvious when we run the driver experiment if we were to look at customer complaints. It is possible that on a small team we would be exposed to those tickets, but on a larger team we may not be. Ensuring that A/B tests are not resulting in false optimization is especially important. This is not something that we typically have to worry about in normal experiments. As an example of this in a real setting <span class="citation" data-cites="duolingo">Aprameya (<a href="99-references.html#ref-duolingo" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> describes testing a feature of Duolingo, a language-learning application, which served an ad for Duolingo Plus when a regular Duolingo user was offline. The feature was found to be positive for Duolingo’s revenue, but negative for customer learning habits and so was not rolled out. Presumably enough customer negativity would eventually have resulted in the feature having a negative effect on revenue. Related to this, we want to think carefully about the nature of the result that we expect. For instance, in the shades of blues example, we are unlikely to find substantial surprises, and so it might be sufficient to try a small range of blues. But what if we considered a wider variety of colors. If we are concerned that there may be fat tails on the distribution, then we need to consider a wider range of experiments than we otherwise would <span class="citation" data-cites="Azevedo2020">(<a href="99-references.html#ref-Azevedo2020" role="doc-biblioref">Azevedo et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>It is also useful to look at the documentation for the dataset. This describes the structure of the dataset, which is that there are packages within tests. A package is a collection of headlines and images that were shown randomly to different visitors to the website, as part of a test. A test can include many packages. Each row in the dataset is a package and the test that it is part of is specified by the ‘clickability_test_id’ column.</p>
<p>There are a variety of variables. We will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘created_at’;</li>
<li>‘clickability_test_id’, so that we can create comparison groups;</li>
<li>‘headline’;</li>
<li>‘impressions’, which is the number of people that saw the package; and</li>
<li>‘clicks’ which is the number of clicks on that package.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within each batch of tests, we are interested in the effect of the varied headlines on impressions and clicks.</p>

<p>We will focus on the text contained in headlines, and look at whether headlines that asked a question got more clicks than those that did not. We want to remove the effect of different images and so will focus on those tests that have the same image. To identify whether a headline asks a question, we search for a question mark. Although there are more complicated constructions that we could use, this is enough to get started.</p>
