## Introduction

`Python` is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum. `Python` version 0.9.0 was released in February 1991, and the current version, 3.13, was released in October 2024. It was named `Python` after *Monty Python's Flying Circus*. 

`Python` is a popular language used in machine learning, but it was designed, and is more commonly used, for more general software applications. This means that we will especially rely on packages. This use of `Python` in this book is focused on data science, rather than other uses.

Knowing `R` will allow you to pick up `Python` for data science quickly. The main data science packages share the need to solve the same underlying problems. That said, there are a number of differences between `R` and `Python`. For instance, white space matters in `Python`.

## Python, VS Code, and uv

We could use `Python` within RStudio, but it makes sense to use what is used by the community more broadly, which is VS Code. You can download VS Code for free [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) and then install it. If you have difficulties with this, then in the same way we started with Posit Cloud and the shifted to our local machine, you could use Google Colab [here](https://colab.google).

Open VS Code, and open a new Terminal to install `uv`, which is a Python package manager, analogous to CRAN: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.

Then we can use `uv` in that Terminal to install Python: `uv python install`.

## Getting started

We are going to get started with an example that downloads some data from Open Data Toronto. To start, we need to create a project, which will allow all our code to be self-contained. Create a new folder and then open it with VS Code. Then we can use `uv init` in the Terminal to do this.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

uv init shelter_usage
cd shelter_usage
```



Simulate data

Write tests

Download data

Apply tests

Manipulate the data

Make a graph

Add it all into Quarto





## Manipulating data

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

import polars as pl
```


## Making graphs
