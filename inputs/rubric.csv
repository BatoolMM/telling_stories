Replication, 0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional', "SSRP submission needs to be filled out completely for three elements."
Title ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Yes'; 2 - 'Exceptional',An informative title is included that explains the story, and ideally tells the reader what happens at the end of it. 'Paper X' is not an informative title. There should be no evidence this is a school paper.
"Author, date, and repo ",0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Yes',"The author, date of submission in unambiguous format, and a link to a GitHub repo are clearly included. (The later likely, but not necessarily, through a statement such as: 'Code and data supporting this analysis is available at: LINK')."
Abstract ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"An abstract is included and appropriately pitched to a non-specialist audience. The abstract answers: 1) what was done, 2) what was found, and 3) why this matters (all at a high level). Likely four sentences. Abstract must make clear what we learn about the world because of this paper."
Introduction,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total."
Estimand,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Done',"The estimand is clearly stated in the introduction."
Data,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. The broader context of the dataset should be discussed. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships between the variables. If this becomes too detailed, then appendices could be used. Basically, for every variable in your dataset that is of interest to your paper there needs to be graphs and explanation and maybe tables."
Measurement,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Some issues'; 3 - 'Good'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"A thorough discussion of measurement, relating to the dataset, is provided in the data section. Please ensure that you explain how we went from some phenomena in the world that happened to an entry in the dataset that you are interested in."
Model,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"The model should be nicely written out, well-explained, justified, and appropriate. Detail the statistical model used, defining and explaining each aspect and its importance, and ensure that variables are well-defined and correspond with those discussed in the data section. The model should have an appropriate balance of complexity—neither overly simplistic nor unnecessarily complicated—and be justified as suitable for the situation. Explain how decisions made in modeling reflect the aspects discussed in the data section, including why specific features are included (e.g., why use age rather than age-groups, treating province effects as levels, categorizing gender, etc?). Present the model using appropriate mathematical notation supplemented with plain English explanations, defining every component. If applicable, define sensible priors for Bayesian models. Clearly discuss the underlying assumptions, potential limitations, and circumstances where the model may not be appropriate. Mention the software used to implement the model, and provide evidence of model validation and checking—such as out-of-sample testing, RMSE calculations, test/training splits, or sensitivity analyses—while addressing model convergence, diagnostics, and any alternative models or variants considered, including their strengths and weaknesses and the rationale for the final model choice."
Results,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"Results will likely require summary statistics, tables, graphs, images, and possibly statistical analysis or maps. There should also be text associated with all these aspects. Show the reader the results by plotting them where possible. Talk about them. Explain them. That said, this section should strictly relay results. Regression tables must not contain stars."
Discussion,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',Some questions that a good discussion would cover include (each of these would be a sub-section of something like half a page to a page): What is done in this paper? What is something that we learn about the world? What is another thing that we learn about the world? What are some weaknesses of what was done? What is left to learn or how should we proceed in the future?
Prose,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Good'; 6 - 'Exceptional',"All aspects of submission should be free of noticeable typos, spelling mistakes, and be grammatically correct.

Referencing,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 3 - 'One minor issue'; 4 - 'Perfect',"All data, software, literature, and any other relevant material, should be cited in-text and included in a properly formatted reference list made using BibTeX. A few lines of code from Stack Overflow or similar, would be acknowledged just with a comment in the script immediately preceding the use of the code rather than here. But larger chunks of code should be fully acknowledged with an in-text citation and appear in the reference list."

Code should be used to do all steps including appropriately read data, prepare it, create plots, conduct analysis, and generate documents. Seeds should be used where needed. Code should have a preamble and be well-documented including comments and layout. The repo should be appropriately organized and not contain extraneous files. setwd() and hard coded file paths must not be used."
