R is appropriately cited ,0 - 'No'; 1 - 'Yes',"Must be referred to in the main content and included in the reference list. If not, no need to continue marking, paper gets 0 overall."
Class paper,0 - 'No'; 1 - 'Yes',"Check meta data such as project and folder names, as well as other aspect such as title etc. If there is any sign this is a class paper then no need to continue marking, paper gets 0 overall."
Replication, 0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional', "SSRP submission needs to be filled out completely for three elements."
Title ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Yes'; 2 - 'Exceptional',An informative title is included that explains the story, and ideally tells the reader what happens at the end of it. 'Paper X' is not an informative title. There should be no evidence this is a school paper.
"Author, date, and repo ",0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Yes',"The author, date of submission in unambiguous format, and a link to a GitHub repo are clearly included. (The later likely, but not necessarily, through a statement such as: 'Code and data supporting this analysis is available at: LINK')."
Abstract ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"An abstract is included and appropriately pitched to a non-specialist audience. The abstract answers: 1) what was done, 2) what was found, and 3) why this matters (all at a high level). Likely four sentences. Abstract must make clear what we learn about the world because of this paper."
Introduction,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total."
Estimand,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Exceptional',"The estimand is clearly stated in the introduction."
Data ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships between the variables. If this becomes too detailed, then appendices could be used."
Measurement,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Exceptional',"Some aspect of measurement, relating to the dataset, is mentioned in the data section."
Model ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"The model should be nicely written out, well-explained, justified, and appropriate."
Results ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"Results will likely require summary statistics, tables, graphs, images, and possibly statistical analysis or maps. There should also be text associated with all these aspects. Show the reader the results by plotting them where possible. Talk about them. Explain them. That said, this section should strictly relay results. Regression tables must not contain stars."
Discussion,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',Some questions that a good discussion would cover include (each of these would be a sub-section of something like half a page to a page): What is done in this paper? What is something that we learn about the world? What is another thing that we learn about the world? What are some weaknesses of what was done? What is left to learn or how should we proceed in the future?
Cross-references,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Yes',"All figures, tables, and equations, should be numbered, and referred to in the text using cross-references."
Prose ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Yes',"All aspects of submission should be free of noticeable typos, spelling mistakes, and be grammatically correct. Prose should be coherent, concise, and clear."
Graphs/tables/etc ,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"Graphs and tables must be included in the paper and should be to well-formatted, clear, and digestible. They should: 1) serve a clear purpose; 2) be fully self-contained through appropriate use of captions and sub-captions; 3) appropriately sized and colored; and 4) have appropriate significant figures, in the case of tables."
Survey,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Many issues'; 4 - 'Some issues'; 6 - 'Good'; 8 - 'Great'; 10 - 'Exceptional',"The survey should have an introductory section and include the details of a contact person. The survey questions should be well constructed and appropriate to the task. The questions should have an appropriate ordering. A final section should thank the respondent."
Reference list,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 3 - 'One minor issue'; 4 - 'Perfect',"All data, software, literature, and any other relevant material, should be cited in-text and included in a reference list made using BibTeX. A few lines of code from Stack Overflow or similar, would be acknowledged just with a comment in the script immediately preceding the use of the code rather than here. But larger chunks of code should be fully acknowledged with an in-text citation and appear in the reference list."
Commits,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 2 - 'Excellent',"There are at least two different commits, and they have meaningful commit messages."
Simulation,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"The script is clearly commented and structured. All variables are appropriately simulated."
Tests,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"Data and code tests are appropriately used."
Parquet,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Exceptional',"The analysis dataset is saved as a parquet file (optionally also as a CSV)."
Reproducibility,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Gets job done'; 2 - 'Fine'; 3 - 'Great'; 4 - 'Exceptional',"The paper and analysis should be fully reproducible. The repo should have a detailed README. All code should be thoroughly documented. An R project should be used. Code should be used to do all steps including appropriately read data, prepare it, create plots, conduct analysis, and generate documents. Seeds should be used where needed. Code should have a preamble and be well-documented including comments and layout. The repo should be appropriately organized and not contain extraneous files. setwd() and hard coded file paths must not be used."
Code style,0 - 'Poor or not done'; 1 - 'Exceptional',"Code is appropriately styled."

General excellence ,"0 - 'None'; 1 - 'Huh, that's interesting'; 2 - 'Wow'; 3 - 'Exceptional'",There are always students that excel in a way that is not anticipated in the rubric. This item accounts for that.
